# Cartmate â€“ High-Level Engineering Procedure & Techniques

This document outlines the **technical approach, flow, and architecture** for building Cartmate using the chosen stack.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack Recap

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router) + shadcn/ui + framer-motion (for UI/animations)
- **Language**: JavaScript (JSDoc, no TypeScript)
- **Database**: NeonDB (PostgreSQL) for persistence
- **Cache/Realtime**: Redis (for caching, pub/sub, WS fan-out)
- **Realtime**: WebSockets (WS)
- **Auth**: JWT-based sessions
- **File Uploads**: uploadThings (profile images <1MB)
- **Email**: Mailgun API (for invites & notifications)

---

## ðŸ”¹ High-Level Flow & Procedures

### 1. Authentication & Session

- JWT stored in **httpOnly cookies** for security.
- Login/Register â†’ JWT issued after validation.
- Middleware in Next.js to protect API routes and WS handshake.

### 2. Database Schema (simplified)

**Users**

- `id, username, email, password_hash, avatar_url`

**Lists**

- `id, name, creator_id, created_at`

**ListMembers**

- `id, list_id, user_id, role (creator|editor|viewer), joined_at`

**Items**

- `id, list_id, name, quantity, notes, done, created_by, updated_at`

**Messages**

- `id, list_id, sender_id, text, mentions_users[], mentions_items[], created_at`

**Invites**

- `id, list_id, token (uuid), expires_at, created_at`

---

### 3. Real-Time with WS + Redis

- **WS connection** established after login (JWT verified).
- Each list = WS channel (room).
- Redis Pub/Sub used for broadcasting:

  - Item updates (add/edit/delete/done)
  - Chat messages
  - Member join/leave

**Flow**:

1. User performs action (e.g., add item).
2. Optimistic update on client state.
3. API call saves to PostgreSQL.
4. After DB commit â†’ publish event via Redis.
5. WS server receives â†’ fan-out to all clients in that list channel.
6. Other clients update state instantly.

---

### 4. Conflict Handling

- **Optimistic UI**: Client assumes success, then reconciles on server ack.
- **Conflict rules**:

  - Last writer wins for simple text fields (e.g., item name).
  - Append-only for chat (no conflict).
  - Timestamps in DB used to resolve collisions.

- **Reconciliation**: If server rejects (e.g., validation), client rolls back optimistic change.

---

### 5. The Real Technique (for Cartmate)

Cartmate will use the same principle as collaborative editors but scoped to shopping lists and chats.

- **Local + WS First (fast path)**

  - Item edits or chat messages are first applied locally and sent over WS.
  - Other members see updates instantly via WS broadcast.
  - No DB hit yet for micro-changes (e.g., when typing a long item name).

- **DB Writes (slow path)**

  - Changes are batched/debounced before writing to Postgres.
  - Example: save after 1â€“2 seconds of inactivity or once an item is confirmed.
  - Reduces DB load and latency.

- **Conflict Resolution Layer**

  - For items: last writer wins unless explicitly locked (optional future feature).
  - For chat: append-only, so no conflict.
  - Timestamps resolve conflicts if two edits hit the same item.

- **Resync on Reconnect**

  - When a member rejoins a list, the latest list state + chat history is fetched from Postgres.
  - Then WS re-subscribes for live updates.

This ensures **Cartmate stays responsive** even under heavy edits and avoids overwhelming NeonDB.

### 6. Invitations (Dynamic URL)

- Invite link = `currentOrigin + "/invite/" + token`

  - Use `window.location.origin` on client to construct, never hardcode.

- Flow:

  1. Creator generates invite token (stored in DB with expiry).
  2. URL shared â†’ e.g., `https://cartmate.com/invite/<token>`
  3. If user not logged in â†’ redirect to login â†’ auto-join after auth.

---

### 7. Notifications

- **Toast (in-app)** â†’ via WS event (e.g., mention, item updated).
- **Email (Mailgun)**:

  - On mentions â†’ send background job via worker.
  - Config from env:

    - `MAILGUN_API_KEY`
    - `MAILGUN_DOMAIN`
    - `MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL`

---

### 8. File Uploads

- UploadThings integration for profile avatar.
- Client â†’ UploadThings signed URL â†’ storage.
- Store only URL reference in PostgreSQL.
- Enforce <1MB check client + server side.

---

### 9. Performance & Responsiveness

- Redis cache for frequently accessed data (list members, items snapshot).
- Use `LISTEN/NOTIFY` in Postgres if needed for DB-triggered events.
- Debounce item edits to prevent WS flooding.
- Use pagination/lazy load in chat (load 50 msgs, fetch more on scroll).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Chronology of Saving & Sync

1. **User action** â†’ UI state updated optimistically (fast path).
2. **Debounced save** â†’ Changes batched and persisted to Postgres (slow path).
3. **After commit** â†’ Redis publish event.
4. **WS broadcast** â†’ All connected members update.
5. **Clients reconcile** â†’ Confirm or rollback change if conflict.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Future-Proofing Hooks

- Add `roles` field for read-only members.
- Extend `items` with categories/tags.
- Add archived lists table.
- Gamification tables for stats & streaks.

---

âœ… This adjusted plan makes Cartmate real-time, avoids DB overload, and ensures smooth UX with fast local updates and reliable persistence.
